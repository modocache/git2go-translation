We really like having faster reviews and faster bug fixes so we kept on going and fixed some really annoying bugs:

- trying to open a Repository from a URL that does not exist is no longer crashing the app
- Repositories that are opened from a URL are now persisted
- Repositories that were cloned from SSH now show up in the local repository list.
- The status bar has no longer the wrong colour when searching in repositories.
- Directory and file names are no longer being truncated
- When navigating while committing is your thing then you can finally use the tab bar when you do so
